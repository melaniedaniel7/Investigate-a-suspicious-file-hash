# Investigate a suspicious file hash

In this activity, I analyzed an artifact using VirusTotal and captured details about its related indicators of compromise using the Pyramid of Pain.

The Pyramid of Pain, is a concept used to understand the different types of indicators of compromise (IoCs). An IoC is observable evidence that suggests signs of a potential security incident. The Pyramid of Pain describes the relationship between IoCs and the level of difficulty that malicious actors experience when the IoCs are blocked by security teams.

VirusTotal is one of many tools that security analysts use to identify and respond to security incidents. VirusTotal is a service that allows anyone to analyze suspicious files, domains, URLs, and IP addresses for malicious content. Through crowdsourcing, VirusTotal gathers and reports on threat intelligence from the global cybersecurity community. This helps security analysts determine which IoCs have been reported as malicious. As an aspiring security analyst, I can take advantage of shared threat intelligence to learn more about threats and help improve detection capabilities. 

It is important to remember that data uploaded to VirusTotal will be publicly shared with the entire VirusTotal community. So one must be careful of what they chose to submit, and make sure to not upload personal information.
